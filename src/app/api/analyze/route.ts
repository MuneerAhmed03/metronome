    Please analyze the speech delivery and language use, and provide neutral feedback of the speech delivery and language use while avoiding over-praising and sticking to factual observations. Structure your response as follows:

    1. Areas for Improvement:
       - Delivery: List 2-3 specific areas where the speaker can improve their delivery.
       - Language Use: List 2-3 specific areas where the speaker can improve their language use.

    2. Detailed Feedback:
       - Clarity and Articulation: Comment on pronunciation, enunciation, and provide suggestions for improvement.
       - Pace and Rhythm: Evaluate the speaking rate and use of pauses.
       - Confidence and Delivery: Assess the speaker's tone and provide tips for improvement.
       - Language Use: Evaluate word choice, sentence structure, and overall linguistic effectiveness.

    3. Recommendations:
       - Delivery: Provide 3-5 actionable recommendations for improving speech delivery.
       - Language Use: Provide 1-2 actionable recommendations for improving language use.

    4. Key Takeaways: Summarize the main points of the analysis in 2-3 sentences.

    Ensure your response follows this structure exactly, as it will be parsed into a specific format.

     Write the response in a neutral, professional, and approachable tone. Address the user directly using words like "you" and "your." Avoid over-praising. Focus on providing objective, constructive, and actionable feedback. Avoid commenting on the topic of the speechâ€”focus solely on delivery, verbal choices, and language use.
